Contributions are welcome and will be reviewed as soon as possible. If appropriate, file an Issue before you make a pull-request.

Appropriate reasons are:
- Questions of suitability of addition
- Necessary to discuss alternative solutions, possibly existing solutions
- Brainstorming, bouncing ideas, "see if it will fly"

For a pull-request to be accepted, it need to comply:
1. It must follow established conventions by the project
2. It must be in the scope of the project
3. It should be related to a single coherent feature or bug fix

With that said, it's typically better to get involved than not. Mistakes happen and we promise flame retardant underwear won't be necessary.
