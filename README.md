# Tiden

Build dynamic web applications using streams, nano-frontends, and modern native web technology.

The library will provide tools and tutorials for building progressive web apps (PWA) using native web technology such as Web Components and ES modules.

## Objectives

- Bring truly modular architecture to the web. 

  Each thing should be able to function as designed on its own. This makes it easier to split work across teams and reduces the work-test-work cycle of development. It also helps to focus at the problem at hand.

- Encourage portability.

  Tiden is built with microservice architecture in mind. A Tiden App may be split in several parts, co-located or stored in separate repositories. Each part may even be hosted independently and have its own release lifecycle. We call these "nano-frontends".

- Don't compromise. Instead, make complexity easier to understand.

  We've all been there. Complexity will appear in a world where a hundred things can happen at any time without any predefined order. One could, of course, opt to make a simpler product, making compromises with the quality of the final result. We think this makes for a bad user experience.

  Tiden uses a form of Message-oriented Programming to increase visibility into the communication between each thing. It clearly defines areas of responsibility, and encourages the programmer to make individual demonstrations of each part.
