# Tiden

Build dynamic web applications using streams, nano-frontends, and modern native web technology.

The library will provide tools and tutorials for building progressive web apps (PWA) using native web technology, such as Web Components and ES modules.

## Objectives

- Modular architecture

  Each thing should be able to function as designed on its own. This makes it easier to split work across teams and reduces the work-test-work cycle of development. It also helps to focus at the problem at hand.

- Portable

  Tiden is built with microservice architecture in mind. A Tiden App may be split in several parts, co-located or stored in separate repositories. Each part may even be hosted independently and have its own release lifecycle. We call these "nano-frontends".

- Insight before compromise

  As developers, we often compromise quality because sophisticated solutions can be hard to understand. We think that makes for a poorer user experience. Instead, Tiden strives to provide logging and visualisations to aid the understanding of what's going on.
